# C++ Modules (CPP Modules)

This repository contains solutions for the **C++ Modules** (CPP00 ~ CPP09), a series of personal study exercises designed to build a strong foundation in object-oriented programming (OOP) using C++. Each module focuses on key C++ features and programming paradigms.

## Purpose

- Gain practical experience with object-oriented programming in C++.
- Understand fundamental and advanced C++ features including inheritance, polymorphism, exceptions, and templates.
- Learn best practices in writing modern, maintainable, and efficient C++ code.

---

## Modules Overview

### CPP00: Basic Concepts
- Understanding namespaces, I/O streams, and basic class creation.
- Practice working with member functions, class constructors, and destructors.

### CPP01: Memory & References
- Deeper look into memory handling in C++.
- References vs pointers, dynamic memory management.
- Introduction to file input/output.

### CPP02: Ad-hoc Polymorphism
- Operator overloading and canonical class form.
- Dealing with deep vs shallow copies.

### CPP03: Inheritance Basics
- Basic inheritance and derived classes.
- Proper destruction of base and derived class objects.

### CPP04: Abstract Classes & Interfaces
- Pure virtual functions, abstract base classes.
- Polymorphism and interface-driven design.

### CPP05: Function Overriding & Virtuals
- Virtual methods and overriding behavior.
- Importance of destructors in polymorphic base classes.

### CPP06: Exception Handling
- C++ exception handling mechanisms (`try`, `throw`, `catch`).
- Creating and using custom exception classes.

### CPP07: Templates
- Function and class templates.
- Template specialization and instantiation.

### CPP08: STL & Containers
- Using Standard Template Library (STL) containers like `vector`, `list`, and `map`.
- Iterators, algorithms, and function objects.

### CPP09: Advanced STL Practice
- Implementation of more complex container-based logic.
- Focus on performance and idiomatic use of C++ STL.

## Build & Run
Each module contains its own subfolder with separate source files and `Makefile`. To build a module:

```bash
cd CPPxx
make
```

To run an executable:

```bash
./program_name
```
